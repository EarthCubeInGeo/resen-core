    "# Citation Helper\n",
    "Resen includes the [citation helper](https://github.com/EarthCubeInGeo/citationhelper) utility, which is a small command-line utility designed to help users identify packages that they may have used in the course of their research so they can be properly cited in any resulting publication.  This utility scans \\*.py scripts in `/home/jovyan/work` or `/home/jovyan/mount` for import statements and generates a unique list of all the impored packages."

The citation helper utility will automatically check this file against the list of packages imported and include the prefered citation in the output report if it is known.

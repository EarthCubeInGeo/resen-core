``resen-core`` is the core docker image used by ``resen``. ``resen`` `(REproducible Software ENvironment) <https://github.com/EarthCubeInGeo/resen>`_, is a tool that enables reproducible scientific data analysis, built using Python and Docker.  ``resen-core`` is built upon an Ubuntu Linux image with Python, Jupyter, and a stack of commonly used Geospace research software libraries and packages pre-installed.

Users who are only interested in using Resen for their scientific research and not developing the system should refer to the `resen documentation <https://resen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.  The files and documentation included in this repository are intended primarily for developers and advanced users who would like to customize their ``resen-core`` docker image.
